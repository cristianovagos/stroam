## How to run STROAM

There is a docker-compose file available with all services and containers for STROAM deployment, 
as well as a Ansible playbook file available for quick remote installation of the deployment environment.

#### Requirements
* **_Ansible_** must be installed on YOUR machine, and Python must be installed on the REMOTE machine (later described as host)
* In our case, the machine where the deployment is done is on a Ubuntu Server 18.04
* It may be required UA/IT VPN access into the deployment host

The Ansible playbook will install all software and packages needed for the Dockerized environment, such as Docker and Docker Compose
as well as pull the code from our repository (code.ua.pt), build and run the containers described in the Docker Compose file.

#### Usage
On **YOUR** machine, copy and paste the hosts file on Ansible config folder ( _/etc/ansible/_ ):
```
$ sudo cp hosts /etc/ansible/hosts
```

(_**OR**, if you already have Ansible hosts installed, just append the contents from this hosts file into your Ansible hosts_):
```
$ sudo cat hosts >> /etc/ansible/hosts
```

Then run the Ansible playbook, requesting password prompts:
```
$ ansible-playbook vm-playbook.yml --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
```
The user password and sudo password of the REMOTE machine will be prompted, as well as YOUR user and password from git repository.

Enjoy STROAM!
